# Tasks: T-SQL to PostgreSQL Database Migration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-tsql-to-pgsql/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Test tasks are included based on the testing requirements defined in the specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each database object type.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a database migration project with the following structure:
- **Database objects**: `source/building/pgsql/refactored/`
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/performance/`
- **Scripts**: `scripts/validation/`, `scripts/deployment/`, `scripts/automation/`
- **Tracking**: `tracking/`

---

## Clarifications Applied (2026-01-23)

**60 clarification questions answered** affecting task execution. Key decisions for implementers:

### Validation Tasks
- **Row validation**: Use row-by-row MD5/SHA256 hash comparison
- **Floating-point tolerance**: 1e-10 relative tolerance acceptable
- **NULL validation**: Compare column-level NULL counts
- **Performance baseline**: Warm cache, 3-run median, production-equivalent data

### Rollback & Recovery Tasks
- **Rollback window**: 7 days (not 30 days)
- **Rollback scope**: Object-level (revert failed object only, keep successful ones)
- **Cutover checkpoint**: Go/no-go decision at hour 6

### Quality Gate Tasks
- **Quality scores**: Tiered by priority (P0≥9.0, P1≥8.0, P2/P3≥7.0)
- **Test coverage**: 100% P0 objects, 90% P1, 80% P2/P3
- **Constitution gate**: Block PROD only (allow DEV/STAGING for iteration)

### Integration Tasks
- **FDW retry**: 3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **FDW pool**: Size 10, lifetime 30 min, idle timeout 5 min
- **FDW validation**: Pre-migration connectivity test in staging
- **Replication SLA**: p95 within 5 minutes
- **Replication alerts**: 2 min info, 5 min warning, 10 min critical

### Deployment Tasks
- **Phase gates**: Automated prerequisite checks, block on failure
- **Schema validation**: Automated pre-deployment scan for unqualified references
- **Constitution compliance**: Automated linting + manual spot-check

### Edge Case Tasks
- **Original 8 edge cases**: P0 priority, mandatory 100% test coverage
- **3 new edge cases**: Empty tables, max-row tables, concurrent DDL

**Full details**: See `spec.md` Clarifications section and `plan.md` Clarifications Applied section

Iterate: Read AWS SCT → Apply constitution → Schema-qualify → Syntax validate. Checkpoint: After every 5 views, commit with quality scores. Gate: Before P0 view, validate ALL 21 dependencies resolved. Output <promise>ANALYSIS COMPLETE</promise> when all 22 views analyzed + quality scores ≥7.0/10.0 + no P0/P1 issues." --completion-promise "ANALYSIS COMPLETE" --max-iterations 50

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - **US1 (Views)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires tables to exist (coordinate with US3)
  - **US2 (Functions)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires views and tables (coordinate with US1, US3)
  - **US3 (Tables)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (foundational for US1, US2)
  - **US4 (FDW)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires tables (coordinate with US3)
  - **US5 (Replication)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires tables (coordinate with US3)
  - **US6 (Jobs)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires all database objects (depends on US1, US2, US3)
- **GooList Type (Phase 9)**: Part of US2 (Functions) - Must complete before function deployment
- **Materialized View Refresh (Phase 10)**: Part of US1 (Views) - Must complete before view deployment
- **Production Cutover (Phase 11)**: Depends on all user stories deployed to STAGING
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: Depends on production cutover completion

### User Story Dependencies (Critical Path)

**Recommended Sequencing**:
1. **Phase 3 (US1 - Views)** and **Phase 5 (US3 - Tables)** in parallel (tables are foundational for views)
2. **Phase 4 (US2 - Functions)** after US1 and US3 (functions depend on views and tables)
3. **Phase 6 (US4 - FDW)** after US3 (FDW depends on tables)
4. **Phase 7 (US5 - Replication)** after US3 (replication depends on tables)
5. **Phase 8 (US6 - Jobs)** after all other stories (jobs depend on all database objects)

**Alternative: Sequential by Priority**:
- User Story 1 (P1) → User Story 2 (P1) → User Story 3 (P1) → User Story 4 (P2) → User Story 5 (P2) → User Story 6 (P3)
- **Risk**: Tables (US3) may block views (US1) and functions (US2) if not coordinated

### Within Each User Story

- Dependency analysis before phase 1 (analysis)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Minimum Viable Migration)

**Recommended MVP**: User Stories 1 + 2 + 3 (Views, Functions, Tables)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Tables) - Foundation for all other objects
4. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Views) - Core data access layer
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Functions) - Core business logic
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all core database objects independently in STAGING
7. Deploy to production if ready (excludes FDW, replication, jobs)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-2): Setup + Foundational → Migration infrastructure ready
2. **Core Objects** (Weeks 3-5): US3 (Tables) + US1 (Views) + US2 (Functions) → Core database functional
3. **External Integration** (Week 6): US4 (FDW) → Cross-database queries restored
4. **Data Synchronization** (Week 7): US5 (Replication) → Warehouse integration restored
5. **Automation** (Week 8): US6 (Jobs) → Full operational capability
6. **Production Cutover** (Week 9): Cutover + 7-day monitoring
7. Each phase adds value without breaking previous phases

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple database engineers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Weeks 1-2)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Engineer A**: User Story 3 (Tables) - CRITICAL PATH
   - **Engineer B**: User Story 1 (Views) - Depends on tables being available
   - **Engineer C**: User Story 2 (Functions) - Depends on views and tables
3. After core objects (US1, US2, US3) complete:
   - **Engineer A**: User Story 4 (FDW)
   - **Engineer B**: User Story 5 (Replication)
   - **Engineer C**: User Story 6 (Jobs)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Tables first**: User Story 3 (Tables) is foundational - must complete before views and functions can be fully tested
2. **Quality gates**: Enforce ≥7.0/10 quality score threshold at each validation phase
3. **Performance validation**: Ensure ≤20% degradation before proceeding to next phase
4. **Dependency order**: Follow dependency analysis files (lote1-4) strictly
5. **Rollback readiness**: Test rollback procedures before production deployment

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Verify quality scores ≥7.0/10 before proceeding to deployment phase
- Document all naming conversions in the mapping table
- Follow constitution's seven core principles throughout implementation
- Maintain SQL Server rollback capability for 7 days post-migration

- **User Story 2 (Functions)**: 35 tasks
- **User Story 3 (Tables)**: 52 tasks
- **User Story 4 (FDW)**: 37 tasks
- **User Story 5 (Replication)**: 29 tasks
- **User Story 6 (Jobs)**: 37 tasks
- **GooList Type (Phase 9)**: 10 tasks (part of US2)
- **Materialized View Refresh (Phase 10)**: 9 tasks (part of US1)
- **Production Cutover (Phase 11)**: 34 tasks
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: 10 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 127 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with other tasks

## Suggested MVP Scope

**MVP = User Stories 1 + 2 + 3 (Core Database Objects)**

This delivers:
- ✅ All 91 tables with data (US3)
- ✅ All 22 views (US1)
- ✅ All 25 functions (US2)
- ✅ All 352 indexes (US3)
- ✅ All 271 constraints (US3)
- ✅ Core database functional for application use

**Deferred to Post-MVP**:
- FDW external integration (US4)
- SymmetricDS replication (US5)
- pgAgent jobs (US6)

**Rationale**: Core objects enable application functionality. External integration and automation can be configured incrementally post-migration.
